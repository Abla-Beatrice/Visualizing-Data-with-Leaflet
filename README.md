## Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Analysis

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Popups providing additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

### Level 2: More Data

Ploting a second data set on my map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 
Pulling in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. 
Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* Ploting a second data set on my map.

* Adding a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Adding layer controls to our map.
